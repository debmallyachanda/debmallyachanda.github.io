Welcome! I am Debmallya Chanda, a Ph.D. candidate jointly enrolled at [Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Italy](https://www.unicatt.it/), and [Bielefeld University](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/), Germany. My research explores the intersections of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and financial frictions, with a particular focus on household heterogeneity and its implications for macroeconomic stability. Utilizing dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, I aim to provide insights into complex economic policy questions and their effects on business cycles and financial systems.

Currently, I am working as an intern in the DG Economics at [Deutsche Bundesbank](https://www.bundesbank.de/en), where I engage in research and analysis related to macroeconomic policy and its broader implications. Before pursuing my Ph.D., I earned a Master’s degree in Quantitative Economics from [Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/) and a Master’s in Physics from the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/). Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I find joy in exploring the arts and artists.
